[Better SystemVerilog Syntax](https://github.com/hankhsu1996/vscode-better-systemverilog-syntax) provides advanced tmLanguage grammar support, aimed at enhancing SystemVerilog syntax highlighting. To ensure robustness, extensive study of the SystemVerilog Language Reference Manual (LRM) was conducted to accurately capture the complexities of the SystemVerilog language.
